\title{A Resourceful Monad for IO}
\maketitle

Monads can be used to model side effects such as IO in functional
programming languages such as Haskell. However monads enforce
computation to be sequenced, so many libraries provide constructs for
concurrency. But now we end up with traditional concurrency issues
such as race conditions and simultaneous resource access.

One idea to help prevent such concurrency bugs is to keep track of the
resources being used by the programs. Separation logic has been used
for this purpose, albeit by making assertions about imperative
programs.  This dissertation creates a type system to make the same
guarantees directly at the type level, and to help the programmer
reason about what resources are in use. A proof of type soundness is
given, which is also formalised within Agda. The final system is
simple, pragmatic and integrates well with existing functional
programming languages, with lots of interesting further directions to
explore in.
