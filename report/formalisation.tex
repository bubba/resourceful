\chapter{Formalisation}

In the previous chapter, we have defined and proved the soundness of
our type system. In this chapter, we will look at how this was
mechanically formalised. By mechanically formalised, we mean to prove
it with a proof assistant.

For this type system, I decided to mechanise this within Agda. Agda is
a dependently typed programming language with an ML syntax, similar to
that of Haskell's. It can be used for general purpose programming, but
because it is rooted on Martin-LÃ¶f intuinistic type theory, it can be
used as a proof assistant as well.

Like many other proof assistants, the way we prove properties within
it is by writing programs that satisfy types. This is known as the
Curry-Howard isomorphism, and allows us to write our propositions that
we wish prove as types for our programs. We can then prove our
propositions by providing a value for the program that satisfies the
type.

In constructive logic (also known as intuitionistic logic),
propositions are usually proved by constructing an object...
