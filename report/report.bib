In each of the two first cases we show that the type inference system is consistent with an operational dynamic semantics. On the module level, polymorphic types correspond to signatures. There is a notion of principal signature. So-called signature checking is the …},

Indeed, it suffices to generalize the inference algorithm used in the ML language, so as to deal with type inequalities, rather than equalities. However, the number of such inequalities is linear in the program size-whence, from a practical point of view, a serious efficiency and readability problem. To solve this problem, one must simplify the inferred constraints. So, after studying the logical …},
